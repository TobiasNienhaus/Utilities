## timelapse.bat / FFMPEG_Timelapse

This is a small batch script, you can put in folder. If you execute it, you can specify an input file and an output file and a target fps. This will create a new file with the same frames as the original file but with a different fps.
This can be used to create a timelapse by entering a higher than original target fps.
The file timelapse.bat just does the task, while timelapse_echo.bat echos everything the file does.
